When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Others can help make changes in your work and help improve it .In local only we can access
our work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
 So that only the relevant changes are reflected.
