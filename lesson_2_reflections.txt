What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialise a git repository , a hidden file containing metadata 
that shows the history of the repository will be formed. It is formed so
that we can clone it to other computers and the history of the repository
is transferred. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository,
it is in between them. It helps to add files one by one from working 
directory to the repository. So we can get different commits for different
logical changes.
